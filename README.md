# Dragon Dashin'

## About

Dragon Dashin' is a Flappy Bird-style game where you play as a dragon flying through its cave while attempting to avoid the pointy rocks in its path.

This game has a main menu, game screen, and a death screen. The death screen features your last score, and the amount of deaths by spikes or by the boundaries during the play session (so it's not saved across devices).

## How to Play

If you've played Flappy Bird or any game similar to it, you already have the knowledge to play. In Dragon Dashin', you can use either your spacebar or your left mouse button to make the dragon character jump up to avoid the obstacles.
